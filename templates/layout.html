  <title>Random Cat Sender</title>
  <!-- About: In doing this I wanted to experiment a bit more with making a basic application. Its not fancy, but it has most of the moving parts of a web-app. Including using Heroku's schedular to re-populate the cats. I'm sure I could find a better way to find cats, but I wanted to play around with twitter and rates, so let's go with this for a bit. I chose Python because I like it, and frankly, I want to work more with python vs other languages. I should probably figure out passenger for deployment on not heroku. But you could run this on a pi and it would be pretty ok. Anyways. Sending cats via text message on the web is pretty fun.  -->
